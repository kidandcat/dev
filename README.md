# Todo

- [ ] Use a markdown file as input (INPUT.md)
- [ ] Advanced model process input and create a markdown checklist of tasks to complete (TASKS.md)
- [ ] Make the AI iterate the tasks without extra user input
- [ ] Nano model executes the tasks step by step and updates the TASKS.md with the changes per step
- [ ] Each step must have 3 clear phases:
  - [ ] Write tests
  - [ ] Write code
  - [ ] Run tests and fix bugs (iterate until passing)
- [ ] Use a markdown file as output (OUTPUT.md)


# Output

- INPUT.md: The user input for the task
- TASKS.md: The list of tasks to complete created by the advanced model from the INPUT.md
- LOG.txt: The log of all the messages and tool calls the AI is doing
- OUTPUT.md: Summary of the changes made to the code and how the process went
